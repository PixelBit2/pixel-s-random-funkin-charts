Here it is! The offical Pixel's Random Funkin Charts Github Page!(long name sorry) Here each download will be avalible, no longer being accessed on a youtube video.


For anyone needing catching up:

Pixel's Random Funkin Charts(PRFC for short,) is a mod made by me that feature any random chart I decided to work on that day. From 10 second songs, to challaging mechanic based songs, there's a verity of charts to play! As time goes on, more and more charts will get added, and Patch Notes will always be on the release bulid, saying what got added, removed, changed, or something entirely different!


so yeah that's that
